This project was created out of experimentation. I was exploring how to draw shapes in the Android SDK and created this memory game concept. Upon starting the game, a circle of random size appears at a random point on the screen. When the user clicks on it, a curtain drops down and covers the screen. After about half second, the curtain disappears and another random circle appears. The user must click on the most recent circle to continue this cycle. If the user gets it wrong, the game ends.
